spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of,,
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be,,
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest,,
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations,,
($1 to $5 000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt,,
status with the IRS.,,
,,
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating,,
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United,,
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a,,
considerable effort  much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up,,
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations,,

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.,,

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project,,
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be,,
freely shared with anyone. For forty years  he produced and,,
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of,,
volunteer support.,,
,,
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed,,
editions  all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in,,
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus  we do not,,
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper,,
edition.,,
,,
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search,,
facility: www.gutenberg.org,,

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm ,,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary,,
Archive Foundation  how to help produce our new eBooks  and how to,,
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.,,
